Starlight Courier — Game Design Document (GDD)
Game Type: 2.5D narrative action‑adventure with light stealth and traversal
Elevator Pitch: A cozy‑tense courier adventure set in a neon, rain‑soaked harbor city at blue hour. As Aya—
with her chatty drone Kilo—you weave through night‑market alleys, outrun corp patrols, and deliver sealed
holographic parcels that change the lives of the people you meet.
1) Vision & Player Experience
Experience Goals - Flow: satisfyingly snappy traversal with readable turns on wet streets. - Tension → Relief:
moments of stealthy evasion punctuated by safehouse warmth. - Cohesion: consistent cel‑shaded look, teal/
magenta/amber palette, blue‑hour rain. - Agency: route choice tradeoffs (fast/dangerous vs safe/slow)
matter.
Design Pillars 1) Readability First — clean silhouettes, clear HUD, navigable paths. 2) Deliveries Have
Stories — parcels nudge micro‑narratives forward. 3) Rain Is a Mechanic — visibility, traction, sound, and
cover all shift with rain. 4) Lightweight Stealth — detection cones, audio/noise, quick resets.
Target Platforms / Audience - PC (keyboard/mouse & controller). Stretch: Steam Deck. - Players who enjoy
traversal, light stealth, and episodic micro‑stories.
2) Narrative & World
Setting: Port‑city sprawl of Aurelia Harbor, packed night markets, cranes, rain haze, paper lanterns,
holograms.
Main Cast - Aya — nimble courier; compassionate, competent, a bit impulsive. - Kilo — small companion
drone; maps, quips, pings threats. - Factions — street vendors, dockers’ union, corp security, neighborhood
fixers.
Theme: connection under surveillance. Deliveries are trust‑building acts.
Story Frame: Each shift is a linked set of deliveries. Small choices (who gets priority, which alley you risk)
ripple into later missions via Reputation and Rumors.
3) Core Loop & Meta Loop
Minute‑to‑Minute (Core Loop) 1) Accept a delivery → 2) Plan a route → 3) Ride/Run → 4) Evade patrols &
hazards → 5) Deliver → 6) Score & Reputation → 7) Upgrade → 8) Next job.
Session Meta: complete 3–5 deliveries per shift; unlock new districts, rumors, and upgrades; meet a
character; optional story beat.
4) Systems Design
4.1 Traversal (On Foot & Mag‑Bike)
Speed (m/s): walk 3.5, jog 5.0; bike cruise 9.0, boost 13.0 (2 s burst).
Acceleration: bike 0.0→cruise in 1.0 s; drift on wet bricks reduces turning radius by 15%.
Traction: rain intensity applies −10/−20/−30% traction tiers; puddles add slip chance (camera shake
micro‑feedback).
Stamina: sprint drains; recover in cover/under awnings (+25% regen).
Boost: consumes Battery; recharges slowly; can be recharged at kiosks.
4.2 Parcels
Each parcel has Integrity and Priority. Integrity decays on collisions; Priority controls time bonus.
Integrity Loss: minor bump −2, heavy collision −12, patrol tackle −25.
Scoring Multiplier: Fragile ×1.2; Time‑Sensitive ×1.3; Secure ×1.4.
4.3 Stealth & Detection
Patrol Vision Cone: 55°/8 m; rain/fog reduce to 35°/6 m.
Noise: sprint +10 noise; bike boost +18; walking +2; rain −6 global.
Concealment: stalls/awnings reduce visibility by 40%; shadows by 20%.
Kilo Ping: one‑shot sonar revealing patrols within 12 m, 20 s cooldown.
AI States: Patrol → Investigate (heard/seen hint) → Pursue → Search → Return.
Break LOS: 3 s plus enter cover to reset.
4.4 Weather & World Modifiers
Rain Intensity: Drizzle / Rain / Downpour influences traction, noise masking, fog density, puddle
spawn.
Wind Gusts: rare; push bike sideways; used for variety set‑pieces.
4.5 Reputation & Progression
Reputation ranks: Rookie → Runner → Courier → Express → Phantom. - Rank raises payout multiplier
(+0%, +5%, +10%, +15%, +20%). - Unlocks Rumor Jobs (branching micro‑stories) and shop inventory.
4.6 Economy & Upgrades
Currency: Creds.
Shops: Night‑market stalls & garage.
Category Examples Effect

5) Controls & Camera
Keyboard/Mouse (PC) - Move: WASD • Sprint: Shift • Interact/Deliver: E • Boost: Space • Kilo Ping: Q • Bike/
On‑foot Toggle: F • Map/Route: M • Pause: Esc.
Controller (Xbox/PS Layout) - Left Stick Move • B/Circle Sprint • X/Square Interact • A/Cross Boost • Y/

Camera: 2.5D side camera with slight parallax; dynamic zoom (1.0–1.2×) on speed/encounter; vignette in
downpour.
6) Levels & Encounters
Districts (act as hubs) 1) Harbor Night Market — tutorial routes, puddles, lanterns.
2) Crane Yards — moving hazards, wind gusts, tighter patrol corridors.
3) Old Canals — bridges, slick stone, shortcuts via locks.
4) Corporate Promenade — high surveillance, faster rewards.
Encounter Palette - Patrol duo on fixed loop; stall collision hazard; puddle cluster; rumor NPC; drone
jammers (disable ping briefly).
Example Route Beat (Harbor Alley) - Start kiosk → lantern gauntlet (visibility shifts) → patrol loop (hide
under awning) → puddle s‑curve (traction test) → delivery balcony.
7) Missions & Templates
Standard Delivery: get parcel A to B intact.
Timed Express: reach before deadline; bonus if >20 s left.
Fragile Run: integrity ≥90%.
Covert Drop: secret stash; patrol density +1 tier.
Chain Run: 3 sequential drops within one shift.
Score = rewardBase * multipliers + timeBonus + integrityBonus + reputationTierBonus
8) UI/UX
HUD: health/stamina, parcel integrity, minimap ping, stealth indicator (eye icon with fill), timer when
active.
Wayfinding: diegetic holographic sign pulses subtly along target route; optional breadcrumb dots.
Menus: job board → route planner; garage → upgrades; codex → rumors, people, places.
Accessibility: UI scale 80–140%; colorblind‑safe HUD set; aim/steer assist; hold‑to‑deliver toggle;
subtitle size/black bars.
9) Audio Direction
Music: lo‑fi synth with rain foley layers; stingers for patrol aggro/escape.
SFX: bike hover hum, puddle splash, fabric rustle, Kilo chirps.
Mix Rules: duck music −6 dB on aggro; boost rain mask in downpour; raise Kilo VO clarity.
10) Art Direction (Quick Ref)
Cel‑shaded, painterly edge; teal/magenta/amber; soft volumetric glow; crisp silhouettes.
Environments exported in Foreground/Mid/Background layers for parallax.
Keep top corners clean for HUD; left‑to‑right leading lines.
11) Technical & Pipeline
Engine: Unity 2022+ (Unreal 5.x compatible).
Performance Targets: 60 FPS @ 1080p, mid‑range laptop; texture memory budget ≤ 800 MB; draw calls ≤
1.2k per scene.
Asset Pipeline 1) Ideation: ChatGPT/Claude brainstorming → prompt drafts.
2) Generation: Midjourney v6 / SDXL / DALL·E per asset spec.
3) Cleanup: inpaint artifacts; upscale (ESRGAN/Topaz).
4) Engine Prep: slice sprites; set PPU; import rules (BC7/ASTC); parallax layers.
5) Grade: LUT application; post‑process volume.
12) Difficulty & Tuning
Modes: Story / Standard / Courier+ (hard).
Patrol cone +10%/+0%/−10%; integrity loss −30%/0%/+30%; deadlines +30%/0%/−20%.
Assist toggles: aim/steer assist, extended aggro break, slow‑mo on near miss (10%).
13) Production Plan (Vertical Slice → Alpha)
Team Roles: design/program (1), art (1), tech art (shared), audio (contract), QA (part‑time).
Milestones (6 weeks) - Wk 1: core movement, camera, HUD shell, Harbor Alley blockout.
- Wk 2: parcel system + timer, basic patrol AI, rain v1, delivery loop.
- Wk 3: mag‑bike handling, Kilo ping, shop stub, two upgrades.
- Wk 4: polish art pass (parallax), mech poster + T‑pose, SFX/Music temp.
- Wk 5: tuning pass, accessibility, save/load, telemetry hooks.
- Wk 6: UX polish, performance, playtest, bug triage → Vertical Slice.
Definition of Done (VS): 3 deliveries playable end‑to‑end; 1 district; 2 patrol types; shop with 3 upgrades;
controller support; 60 FPS on mid‑range.
14) QA & Playtesting
Heuristics: clarity of route, fairness of patrol telegraphing, rain readability.
Playtests: 5‑minute loops; track fail reasons; A/B route readability (sign glow off/on).
KPIs: avg deliveries/shift ≥3.5; fail→retry under 20 s; players choose high‑risk path ≥30% of time.
15) Risks & Mitigations
Art Consistency Drift → lock seeds/palettes; brief paint‑over pass.
Stealth Frustration → fast resets; generous concealment in rain; audio telegraph.
Performance in Downpour → particle LOD & GPU instancing; cap puddle decals.
16) Roadmap (Post‑VS)
District 2 (Crane Yards), patrol archetype B, 5–8 new deliveries, new upgrade tier, rumor chain #1.
