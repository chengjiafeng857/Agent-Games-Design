# Important items/accessories the character carries as equipment.
# These define character identity and role at a glance.
# NOTE: Props appear as equipment on body, NOT held in hands (T-pose requirement)
#
# CRITERIA:
#   ✓ Count: 1-4 items (more = cluttered design)
#   ✓ Format: [item] + [body location] (e.g., "sword on back", "tablet on hip")
#   ✓ Include: items that define the role, signature weapons/tools
#   ✓ Location: MUST specify where on body (hip, back, belt, arm-mounted, etc.)
#   ✓ Avoid: items that would be held in hands (breaks T-pose)

#   ✓ Visibility: items should be clearly visible, not hidden under clothing
#
# Good: "data tablet on left hip", "sword strapped to back"
# Bad: "holding a sword" (breaks T-pose), "small ring" (not visible)

#
# CRITERIA:
#   ✓ Count: 2-6 animation types (core movement set)
#   ✓ Format: simple verb or verb phrase
#   ✓ Include: locomotion (walk/run), idle, primary action, combat if applicable
#   ✓ Consider: will clothing/props interfere with these movements?
#   ✓ Avoid: overly complex animations for simple characters

#
# Design check: if character has flowing cape, can they still "run" without clipping?
#
# Good: ["walk", "idle", "attack", "cast spell"] (clear, achievable)

# CRITERIA:
#   ✓ Length: 1-3 sentences (brief, focused)
#   ✓ Format: comma-separated descriptors or short phrases
#   ✓ Include any of:
#       - Environment/setting context (helps AI understand aesthetic)

# ============================================================================
# TIPS FOR GOOD CHARACTER SPECS
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. BE SPECIFIC: "tall android with trench coat" > "robot character"
#
# 2. THINK 3D: Will this design work when converted to 3D?
#    - Avoid overly complex details that won't translate
#    - Consider how clothing/armor will deform during animation
#
# 3. COLOR WISELY: 2-4 colors usually work best
#    - Too many colors look chaotic
#    - Include one "accent" color for visual interest
#
# 4. PROPS MATTER: Items define character identity
#    - A mage without a staff looks like anyone
#    - Props should be clearly visible, not hidden
#
# 5. SILHOUETTE TEST: Would you recognize this character as a shadow?
#    - Distinctive shapes help recognition
#    - Avoid generic "human standing" shapes
