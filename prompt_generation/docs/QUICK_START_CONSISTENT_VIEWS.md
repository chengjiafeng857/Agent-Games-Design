# Quick Start: Consistent Multi-View Generation

## What's New?

Character views (front, side, back) are now **consistent** - they show the same character instead of variations.

## How It Works

1. **Front view** generated from text prompt
2. **Side view** generated by editing the front view  
3. **Back view** generated by editing the front view

Result: All three views show the **exact same character**.

## Usage

### Generate All Views (Consistent)

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key'

# Generate consistent views for a character
uv run generate_prompts.py images -i configs/generated_config_Aya.yaml

# Or run the full pipeline
uv run generate_prompts.py all -i configs/generated_config_Aya.yaml
```

### Test the Feature

```bash
# Quick test (with confirmation prompt)
uv run test_consistent_views.py
```

## Expected Output

```
Using model: gemini-3-pro-image-preview
Resolution: 2K, Aspect ratio: 1:1
Strategy: Sequential generation (front → side/back) for consistency
  Generating front view (reference)...
    ✓ front view generated
  Generating side view from front view reference...
    ✓ side view generated (based on front view)
  Generating back view from front view reference...
    ✓ back view generated (based on front view)
```

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent facial features** across all views  
✅ **Consistent clothing details** and colors  
✅ **Consistent proportions** and style  
✅ **Better 3D models** from consistent input  
✅ **Fewer regenerations** needed  

## What Changed?

### Before
- 3 independent API calls
- Each view generated from text prompt
- Often inconsistent results

### After  
- 1 initial + 2 dependent API calls
- Side/back generated from front view image
- Guaranteed consistency

## Examples

### Before (Inconsistent)
```
Front: Character with short hair, blue jacket
Side:  Character with long hair, blue jacket  ❌
Back:  Character with medium hair, green jacket ❌
```

### After (Consistent)
```
Front: Character with short hair, blue jacket
Side:  Same character, short hair, blue jacket ✓
Back:  Same character, short hair, blue jacket ✓
```

## API Cost

Same as before: 3 API calls to Gemini
- Just using a different strategy for side/back views

## Troubleshooting

**Q: What if I only want side view?**  
A: It will generate independently (no front reference)

**Q: Can I use an existing front view?**  
A: Currently no, but this is a planned enhancement

**Q: Does this work with the old configs?**  
A: Yes! 100% backward compatible
